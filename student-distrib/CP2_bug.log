Description:
    Keyboard:  symbol ' and backspace is wrong
Solution:
    - the mapping of single quate is wrong, since there is some C syntax difference,
    I use a macro #define to record its correct ascii value.
    - I modify the putc logic, develop it into putc_advance

Description:
    - backspace firstly delete a strange space, then delete the target character
    - backspace can't delete the character at the left side of screen_x, it will display
    a \b instead
Solution:
    - The order between screen_x-- and backspacee() is wrong, I exchange them, and it's fine
    -

Description:
    Scrolling will meet with paging error.
Solution:
    Because the screen_y boundary is set wrong, I previously
    messed up with NUM_ROWS and NUM_COLS, this cause many 
    misunderstanding on it.

Description:
    After press the enter, and then press the backspace to delete the empty Keyboard buffer. Normally, it should
    do nothing because the buffer is empty. However, our cursor goes back to the end of the last line.
Solution:
    We forget to return after we consider the cases. Actually, when we press the enter, \n is put into the buffer.
    but we have no need to consider backspace this case. Because after press the \n we should clear all stuff in the 
    buffer.
