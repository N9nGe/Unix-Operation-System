Description:
    Double ls bug: The first time in shell to execute "ls" is fine. 
    But Second time, the system can't read the file after verylargetextwithverylongname.tx
    it will generate:
... (correct ls)
verylargetextwithverylongname.tx
:-) ( a emoji like symbol)
failed to read fd: 2562
directory entry read failed
program terminated abnoramally

    This bug is detacted right before the ddl of CP3. And TA points it out. 
Solution:
    1. the smile symbol and fd 2562 is fixed, that may be the breakpoint
    2. TA said in demo, this may because the system's parameter and return value doesn't fit
    well with the userlevel syscall program. We should check that.
        - Tony debug a datatype error, but nothing happens
    3.
